	abstract = {Although the atmospheric sciences community has been studying the effects of atmospheric stability and surface roughness on the planetary boundary layer for some time, their effects on wind turbine dynamics have not been well studied. In this study, we performed numerical experiments to explore some of the effects of atmospheric stability and surface roughness on wind turbine dynamics. We used large-eddy simulation to create atmospheric winds and compute the wind turbine flows, and we modeled the wind turbines as revolving and flexible actuator lines coupled to a wind turbine structural and system dynamic model. We examined the structural moments about the wind turbine blade, low-speed shaft, and nacelle; power production; and wake evolution when large 5-{MW} turbines are subjected to winds generated from low- and high-surface roughness levels representative of offshore and onshore conditions, respectively, and also neutral and unstable atmospheric conditions. In addition, we placed a second turbine 7 rotor diameters downwind of the first one so that we could explore wake effects under these different conditions. The results show that the turbulent structures generated within the atmospheric boundary layer wind simulations cause isolated loading events at least as significant as when a turbine is waked by an upwind turbine. The root-mean-square {(RMS)} turbine loads are consistently larger when the surface roughness is higher. The {RMS} blade-root out-of-plane bending moment and low-speed shaft torque are higher when the atmospheric boundary layer is unstable as compared with when it is neutral. However, the {RMS} yaw moments are either equal or reduced in the unstable case as compared with the neutral case. For a given surface roughness, the ratio of power produced by the downwind turbine relative to that of the upwind turbine is 15–20\% higher when the conditions are unstable as compared with neutral. For a given atmospheric stability, this power ratio is 10\% higher with the onshore roughness value versus the offshore one. The main conclusion is that various coherent turbulent structures that form under different levels of atmospheric stability and surface roughness have important effects on wind turbine structural response, power production, and wake evolution.},

	abstract = {It is well known that when wind turbines are deployed in large arrays, their efficiency decreases due to complex interactions among themselves and with the atmospheric boundary layer {(ABL).} For wind farms whose length exceeds the height of the {ABL} by over an order of magnitude, a “fully developed” flow regime can be established. In this asymptotic regime, changes in the streamwise direction can be neglected and the relevant exchanges occur in the vertical direction. Such a fully developed wind-turbine array boundary layer {(WTABL)} has not been studied systematically before. A suite of large eddy simulations {(LES)}, in which wind turbines are modeled using the classical “drag disk” concept, is performed for various wind-turbine arrangements, turbine loading factors, and surface roughness values. The results are used to quantify the vertical transport of momentum and kinetic energy across the boundary layer. It is shown that the vertical fluxes of kinetic energy are of the same order of magnitude as the power extracted by the forces modeling the wind turbines. In the fully developed {WTABL}, the kinetic energy extracted by the wind turbines is transported into the wind-turbine region by vertical fluxes associated with turbulence. The results are also used to develop improved models for effective roughness length scales experienced by the {ABL.} The effective roughness scale is often used to model wind-turbine arrays in simulations of atmospheric dynamics at larger (regional and global) scales. The results from the {LES} are compared to several existing models for effective roughness lengths. Based on the observed trends, a modified model is proposed, showing improvement in the predicted effective roughness length.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of atmospheric boundary layer {(ABL)} flow and its interactions with wind turbines and wind farms is critical for optimizing the design (turbine siting) of wind energy projects. Large-eddy simulation {(LES)} can potentially provide the kind of high-resolution spatial and temporal information needed to maximize wind energy production and minimize fatigue loads in wind farms. However, the accuracy of {LESs} of {ABL} flow with wind turbines hinges on our ability to parameterize subgrid-scale {(SGS)} turbulent fluxes as well as turbine-induced forces. This paper focuses on recent research efforts to develop and validate an {LES} framework for wind energy applications. {SGS} fluxes are parameterized using tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic models. These models optimize the local value of the model coefficients based on the dynamics of the resolved scales. The turbine-induced forces (e.g., thrust, lift and drag) are parameterized using two types of models: actuator-disk models that distribute the force loading over the rotor disk, and actuator-line models that distribute the forces along lines that follow the position of the blades. Simulation results are compared to wind-tunnel measurements collected with hot-wire anemometry in the wake of a miniature three-blade wind turbine placed in a boundary layer flow. In general, the characteristics of the turbine wakes simulated with the proposed {LES} framework are in good agreement with the measurements in the far-wake region. Near the turbine, up to about five rotor diameters downwind, the best performance is obtained with turbine models that induce wake-flow rotation and account for the non-uniformity of the turbine-induced forces. Finally, the {LES} framework is used to simulate atmospheric boundary-layer flow through an operational wind farm.},

	abstract = {A recently-developed large-eddy simulation framework is validated and used to investigate turbulent flow within and above wind farms under neutral conditions. Two different layouts are considered, consisting of thirty wind turbines occupying the same total area and arranged in aligned and staggered configurations, respectively. The subgrid-scale {(SGS)} turbulent stress is parametrized using a tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic {SGS} model. The turbine-induced forces are modelled using two types of actuator-disk models: (a) the ‘standard’ actuator-disk model {(ADM-NR)}, which calculates only the thrust force based on one-dimensional momentum theory and distributes it uniformly over the rotor area; and (b) the actuator-disk model with rotation {(ADM-R)}, which uses blade-element momentum theory to calculate the lift and drag forces (that produce both thrust and rotation), and distributes them over the rotor disk based on the local blade and flow characteristics. Validation is performed by comparing simulation results with turbulence measurements collected with hot-wire anemometry inside and above an aligned model wind farm placed in a boundary-layer wind tunnel. In general, the {ADM-R} model yields improved predictions compared with the {ADM-NR} in the wakes of all the wind turbines, where including turbine-induced flow rotation and accounting for the non-uniformity of th e turbine-induced forces in the {ADM-R} appear to be important. Another advantage of the {ADM-R} model is that, unlike the {ADM-NR}, it does not require a priori specification of the thrust coefficient (which varies within a wind farm). Finally, comparison of simulations of flow through both aligned and staggered wind farms shows important effects of farm layout on the flow structure and wind-turbine performance. For the limited-size wind farms considered in this study, the lateral interaction between cumulated wakes is stronger in the staggered case, which results in a farm wake that is more homogeneous in the spanwise direction, thus resembling more an internal boundary layer. Inside the staggered farm, the relatively longer separation between consecutive downwind turbines allows the wakes to recover more, exposing the turbines to higher local wind speeds (leading to higher turbine efficiency) and lower turbulence intensity levels (leading to lower fatigue loads), compared with the aligned farm. Above the wind farms, the area-averaged velocity profile is found to be logarithmic, with an effective wind-farm aerodynamic roughness that is larger for the staggered case.},
